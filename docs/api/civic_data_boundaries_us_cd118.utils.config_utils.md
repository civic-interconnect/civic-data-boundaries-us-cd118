# Module `civic_data_boundaries_us_cd118.utils.config_utils`

## Classes

### `Path(self, *args, **kwargs)`

PurePath subclass that can make system calls.

Path represents a filesystem path but unlike PurePath, also offers
methods to do system calls on path objects. Depending on your system,
instantiating a Path will return either a PosixPath or a WindowsPath
object. You can also instantiate a PosixPath or WindowsPath directly,
but cannot instantiate a WindowsPath on a POSIX system or vice versa.

## Functions

### `load_layer_config(layer_name: str) -> dict`

Load configuration for a given layer, merged with global defaults.
